    "{female_name0}, the {living_adjective0} {noun0}, was prowling around a lush field, when she found a rather {living_adjective1} {noun1}. She could not believe it! It was a surprising find, but that is when the irony of the situation landed on her...",
    "It was a sunny day that {male_name0} decided to take a walk outside, {male_name0} was quite the {living_adjective0} {noun0}; his friends had always told him that he was very {living_adjective1}. Well, he was going to put an end to it very, very soon...",
    "{male_name0} wasn't happy with the situation. He had contacted {female_name0} about the mysterious {object_noun0} he had found lying around. She hadn't called him back. The {object_noun0} was surprisingly {object_adjective0}. {male_name0} wasn't sure if that was any clue to what was going on...",
    "The one thing {female_name0} had asked that {living_adjective0} {noun0} was that he took care of that thieving {noun1}. She didn't know what to do anymore. It was then that she saw {a}{object_noun0} figuratively staring at her... This was going to be fun.",
    "It is difficult enough these days to be taken seriously as {a}{noun0}, but {male_name0} had really gotten the short end of the stick here. He sometimes wondered if it was all in his mind, until one particularly {living_adjective0} {noun1} made it clear.",
    "{female_name0} had never been a morning type of {noun0}, but today was going to be different, she was excited to go outside and explore. Apparently, her team had found {a}{landscape0} just next to some ruins they'd found last year, and she was on the expedition list...",
    "The blade almost made contact with the {noun0}, he had never felt the adrenaline hit him like this. {female_name0} was putting a good fight, but it would be nil once he revealed his secret weapon. {male_name0} pocketed one hand, and swiftly produced {a}{object_adjective0} {object_noun1}!",
    "The ship crawled to a halt as {female_name0} fought to steer it away from the course to the Sun, the warp drive had fatally malfunction, and now she was stranded in the middle of space with {a}{object_adjective0} {object_noun0} and {a}{object_adjective1} {object_noun1}.",

    "There were {plural}{object_noun0} flying everywhere! {female_name0} found herself in utter chaos. She'd heard of that black Friday deal, but this is not what she expected when going to buy {a}{object_adjective0} microwave.",
    "The harshness of this frigid winter was wearing down on {male_name0} quickly. He had thankfully found an old-abandoned cabin near a set of {plural}{landscape0}. The cabin held an assortment of strange items, among which was {a}{object_adjective0} {object_noun0}.",
    "Curiosity nagged on {female_name0}. She had gotten stuck at work after a particularly intense blizzard. Now, she was staring at {a}{object_adjective0} door with the label \"Certified Personnel Only\" inscribed in bold. She pushed the creaking door open...",

He had the mind to call on his trusty companions; {male_name1} the {living_adjective0} {noun0} and {female_name0} the {living_adjective1} {noun1}.",

    "{female_name0} went on a rampage after she found that {object_adjective0} letter in her home. She didn't know whether to feel inspired or terrified. The first thing she managed to do was grab her phone and call her friend {female_name1}... Perhaps she would know.",
    "{female_name0} waved her hand amidst the fog in front of her... She couldn't see well at all. She was sure she'd found {a}{landscape0} somewhere nearby, but she'd lost it when she was knocked away by a gust of wind. The wind... oddly carried the smell of {object_adjective0} {plural}{object_noun0}.",
    "{male_name0} was obsessed with numbers and the relationships between them. He'd written several books around the matter; his latest (supposed) advancement consisted on the relationship between the number 7 and {plural}{object_noun0}... He found it beyond curious."
